## Heritage Nest Frontend Repository

Welcome to Heritage Nest Frontend Repository, This project was developed only for the job task of SM Technology at bdCalling IT Limited. This website is not used for professional purposes. It is a simple website but it has outstanding eye-catching features. In this, you won't know this task shortly and how this project runs locally. My journey was amazing when I developed this application. I am proud to work on this task. Thank you bdCalling for giving me this opportunity.

## Conclusion

Thank you for you time.
